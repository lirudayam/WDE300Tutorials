## Exercise 4

  

	- Change your changeImage function
	
		- Instead of using a boolean to switch between two image, create an array containing at least 4 different image urls
		
		- Replace your boolean variable my an integer variable with the init value of 0 (should later be your pointer to the array)
		
		- Replace your if else statement by following:
		
			- Increase your integer variable by one
			
			- Implement an if for the case that your integer value equals the array length (check if you are over the last position of the array)
			
			- In case of a true if condition, set your integer value back to 0
			
			- change the src of your image to the integer-th value of your array
			
	- In your html file, give your image an height attribute, so your page height does not change when you change your images



You can find a sample solution in the index.html file. You do not need to use the sample solution as the exercises are not based on specifications which haven't been mentioned in the task. So you can just continue with your HTML file.
