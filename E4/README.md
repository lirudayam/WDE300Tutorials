## Exercise 4

  

	- Create a new JS File called script.js
	
	- Implement it in your HTML file
	
	- Give your image an id
	
	- In your JS File
	
		- create a boolean variable with an init value true
		
		- create a function called changeImage
		
			- create a variable which references to your image of the HTML (use your given id)
			
			- do a simple if-else which checks weather your boolean variable is true or false
			
			- if your boolean is true, change the src attribute of your image and set the boolean to false -> just use a different picture
			
			- if your boolean is false, change the src attribute back to the original src and set the boolean to true
			
			- for each time your function has been called, do a console log output
			
	- trigger your function on an event of your image, i.e. via onclick or onmouseover and onmousedown...



You can find a sample solution in the index.html file. You do not need to use the sample solution as the exercises are not based on specifications which haven't been mentioned in the task. So you can just continue with your HTML file.
