## Exercise 6

	- Put your image of your html into a div container with a new class which you implement in your css file

	- Modify your changeImage function, so instead of replacing the picture, it creates new ones
	
		- Remove the line where you change the src attribute
		
		- Create two new variables: one gets parentNode of the image variable and the other one creates a clone of it (cloneNode)
		
		- Change the src of the clone like you did it before to the original
		
		- Append che clone child to the parent variable
			
	- In your html file, give your image an height attribute, so your page height does not change when you change your images



You can find a sample solution in the index.html file. You do not need to use the sample solution as the exercises are not based on specifications which haven't been mentioned in the task. So you can just continue with your HTML file.
